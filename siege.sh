You will need to supply: \n
 ðŸ‘‰ An optional location to save test logs \n
 ðŸ‘‰ The concurrent number of requests to make \n

After that, you can either choose to run it in single-endpoint mode:
 ðŸ‘‰ An endpoint \n
 ðŸ‘‰ The verb, or type of request you are making \n
 ðŸ‘‰ The body of the request \n

Or you can read in a text file of endpoints and verbs for each request. 
It has to be in this format - and if you need any authentication for those endpoints
in the form of query params, put them in there too: 
# comments behind hashes
http://homer.whoohoo.com/cgi-bin/hello.pl POST name=homer
http://homer.whoohoo.com/haha.jsp POST word=doh!&scope=ALL

# To post the contents of a file, use the redirect character <:
http://www.haha.com/reader.php POST < /path/to/file

# If you need authentication AND post file contents, its best to put the params in 
# URL directly instead of separating them out
