# siege-tests

Bash script which makes use of the popular CLI tool, Siege, to provide a simple interface that simplifies running API tests using Siege. This came about due to the vast number of flags that Siege can potentially take, which makes it hard to remember how exactly to customise your tests.

## Setup

Make sure you have Siege installed, either compiling like [their instructions](https://github.com/joedog/siege#installation)
suggest, or through Homebrew (on MacOS).

## Instructions

Run it via `bash ./siege.sh` after cloning it locally.
